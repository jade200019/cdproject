# How to Use
Clone the code to a local folder. 

Use Clion in Ubuntu 18.08 to load the project. 

Install the library `OpenCV 3.4.5`. 

If the program cannot open the input file, 
check `Run/Debug Configurations` and set the `Working directory` as the direct path of the local folder,
e.g. `/home/YOUR_USER_NAME/cdproject`.
